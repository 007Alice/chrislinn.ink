## Monetary policy: Keep it up
ALMOST TEN years into the recovery from the financial crisis, American monetary-policymakers are still finding that inflation is strangely quiescent. Every time price pressures seem to build, they then dissipate. The latest peak was in July 2018. Inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, which the Federal Reserve tries to pin at 2%, was at 2.4%, and, in a rare heated moment—by the standards of the past decade— consumer-price inflation hit 2.9%. But since then, even as unemployment has stayed low, both measures have sagged to below 2% once again.

在金融危机复苏近 10 年之后，美国的货币政策制定者仍然发现通货膨胀奇怪地处于静止状态。每当物价压力看起来要增加时，它们又会消散。最新的峰值发生在 2018 年 7 月。通过个人消费支出（PCE）指数衡量的通货膨胀率为 2.4％，



，在一个罕见的激烈时刻 - 按照标​​准过去十年 - 消费者物价通胀率达到2.9％。


但从那以后，即使失业率居高不下，这两项指标再次下挫至2％以下。

The absence of stronger inflationary pressure has been a little bruising for the Fed. It has long predicted that upward price pressures would result from the economy—and in particular, the labour market—pushing against its natural limits. In preparation for that event, it has raised interest rates nine times since December 2015. Along the way it has explained dips in inflation as temporary. But self-doubt has grown all the while. Weakness in inflation is one reason that rate rises are on hold today, with Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair, emphasising the need for patience.

没有更强的通胀压力对美联储来说有点瘀伤。长期以来一直预测，经济 - 特别是劳动力市场 - 推动其自然限制将导致价格上涨。为了准备这一事件，它自2015年12月以来已经九次加息。在此过程中，它已经解释了通货膨胀是暂时性的。但自我怀疑一直在增长。通货膨胀疲软是今天加息的原因之一，美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔强调需要耐心。

Inflation is notoriously noisy, and therefore tricky to forecast. Energy prices, which are volatile, are responsible for much of the fall since last July. Core PCE inflation, which strips out food and energy, also rose in mid-2018—to 2%, exactly where the Fed wants it. But its subsequent fall has been small: a tenth of a percentage point between July and December. The risk is that this trend, though gentle, proves to be persistent. Figures for January were due to be released on March 29th, after The Economist went to press. The Cleveland Fed estimates that they will show another slight fall. Falling core inflation can suggest a weakening economy. But only some components of inflation are procyclical. Restaurant meals, furniture and housing all seem to get pricier more quickly in booms. Other prices—like those of health care, financial services, clothes and transport—seem to follow their own tune. The increase in core PCE inflation in the first half of 2018 was mainly driven by such “acyclical” prices, according to an analysis by Adam Shapiro of the San Francisco Fed. Around half of the rise was caused by changes in prices of mobile-phone contracts and heftier charges and fees for financial services, a category that includes levies on credit-cards and cash machines.

通货膨胀是出了名的嘈杂，因此预测很棘手。能源价格波动很大，是自去年7月以来大部分跌幅的原因。消除食品和能源的核心PCE通胀在2018年中期也上涨至2％，正是美联储所希望的。但其随后的下降幅度很小：7月至12月间为十分之一个百分点。风险是这种趋势虽然温和，但证明是持久的。 “经济学人”出版后，1月的数据将于3月29日公布。克利夫兰联储估计他们将再次出现小幅下滑。核心通胀下降可能表明经济疲软。但只有通货膨胀的一些组成部分是顺周期性的。餐厅用餐，家具和住房似乎在繁荣时期更快。其他价格 - 如医疗保健，金融服务，服装和运输 - 似乎遵循自己的调整。根据旧金山联邦储备银行的亚当夏皮罗的分析，2018年上半年核心PCE通胀的上升主要受到这种“非周期性”价格的推动。大约一半的增长是由于移动电话合同价格的变化以及金融服务的较高费用和费用造成的，这一类别包括信用卡和自动提款机的征税。

What goes up can come down. A similar exercise by Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics, a consultancy, finds that the fall in core inflation since mid-2018 also reflects the acyclical part of the inflation mix. The cyclical component of inflation, meanwhile, has not much changed. It remains 0.7 percentage points below the average for 2004-07 (see chart). Amid signs of a slowdown in economic growth, there are even some indications that this component could be weakening. Rental costs for housing (including imputed rents) have shown some signs of moderating, for example, having previously been galloping upwards.

可能会出现什么情况。咨询公司牛津经济学的格雷戈里•达科（Gregory Daco）的一项类似演习发现，自2018年中期以来核心通胀的下降也反映了通胀组合的非周期性部分。与此同时，通胀的周期性因素并没有太大变化。它比2004  -  07年的平均值低0.7个百分点（见图表）。在经济增长放缓的迹象中，甚至有迹象表明这一部分可能会减弱。住房租金（包括推算租金）已显示出一些缓和的迹象，例如，之前已经开始上涨。

In combination, these pieces of research suggest that underlying inflationary pressure did not subside in the second half of 2018, because it was never there in the first place. But that poses a bigger puzzle: why has the cyclical component of inflation been so muted, given the apparent strength of America’s labour market? That is the question for economists to tackle— ideally before it becomes moot.

综合起来，这些研究表明，潜在的通胀压力并没有在2018年下半年消退，因为它从来没有出现过。但这带来了一个更大的困惑：考虑到美国劳动力市场的明显优势，为什么通货膨胀的周期性成分如此低调呢？这是经济学家在成为没有实际意义之前解决问题的问题。
