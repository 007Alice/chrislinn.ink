## The world this week
An explosion at a pesticide factory in Xiangshui, a county in the Chinese province of Jiangsu, killed at least 78 people. It was China’s worst industrial accident since 2015. See article.

The Chinese Communist Party expelled Meng Hongwei, a former president of Interpol and vice-minister of public security. The party accused Mr Meng of accepting “huge amounts” of money and gifts in exchange for appointments, and of using public money to fund his family’s “extravagant” lifestyle. He was detained last year, while still in office at Interpol’s headquarters in France, during a trip to Beijing.

China’s Tsinghua University suspended a legal scholar, Xu Zhangrun, from his teaching posts and placed him under investigation because of articles he wrote criticising China’s president, Xi Jinping.


China’s president, Xi Jinping, visited Europe. In Rome, the Italian government signed an agreement to take part in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the first G7 country to do so. Dozens of trade deals were signed with other European countries. Mr Xi also attended a summit with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel.

The British government said that telecoms gear made by Huawei remains riddled with bugs and security flaws, and that the Chinese firm shows little sign of addressing the problems. America has publicly warned its allies against using Huawei’s kit, citing espionage worries, though not all have followed its advice.
