## China’s future: The global centre 

<!-- It was only in the 1990s that China settled on a model that has, in many
respects, persisted to this day. It started evaluating local officials by how
quickly the economy grew under their watch. They, in turn, competed with
each other to woo firms, offering them cheap land, tax breaks and low-cost
labour. Transforming the bureaucracy into something more like a large
startup business, hungry to expand, yielded dramatic results. China accounted
for 4% of the global economy in 1990; now that is close to 18%.

Three factors have underpinned this model. Each can be found in the origins
of the Global Centre. The first is land, all of which is publicly owned. This
puts a valuable asset at the disposal of local officials. They can offer cheap
long-term rents to attract businesses or sell big leaseholds to developers. As
long as growth continues, this is sound economic logic. Developers buy up
land, assuming, mostly correctly, that they can sell what they build. For local
governments it is a source of wealth. In Sichuan province, of which Chengdu
is the capital, land sales bring in nearly as much as taxes.

A second feature of China’s economy is cronyism. 
...

Mr Li’s fortunes turned soon after Xi Jinping came to power in 2013. Jailed
for graft related to construction, he is one of the dozens of high-flying local
leaders cut down by Mr Xi’s anti-corruption campaign. Mr Deng himself was
detained but never publicly charged. The official line is that he was asked to
“assist an investigation”, a euphemism for helping the party net a bigger fish.




Still, Mr Li’s downfall offers a window into the nexus between government
and business. Local officials can dole out contracts in exchange for benefits,
like covering their children’s tuition overseas or buying homes for their
relatives. The path is then clear for projects that in other countries would be
almost inconceivable.
The third feature in China’s model is debt (see chart). Mr Deng bought the
land in 2008 just as the country embarked on a manic phase of growth.
Worried about drag from the global financial crisis, Beijing unleashed a huge
stimulus. Local officials ran up debts, and seized lots of land for
development. A building boom ensued.

The Global Centre is one of the many projects from that period that dot the
country. Some are useful, such as China’s high-speed rail network. Others,
less so: scores of cities built big futuristic districts but are still struggling to
attract residents. China’s total debt soared from about 150% of GDP in 2008 to
more than 250% today. Rapid increases of this magnitude have presaged
financial trouble elsewhere, from the banking crises that ripped through the
West a decade ago to Japan’s stagnation in the 1990s.

Yet the striking thing about these three factors in China’s economic system is
that they were all useful until recently. The government’s control of land
gave it a lever to kick-start investment. Land also played an overlooked role
in governance, says Michael Song, an economist at the Chinese University of
Hong Kong. In a large country with a lack of accountability, it functioned as
a disciplining tool. To raise the value of land, officials had to invest in
infrastructure, from highways to power grids. If they did not, they would
have a harder time selling land in the future.


Many economists
believe that corruption
was, counter-intuitively,
a lubricant for growth



Many economists also believe that corruption
was, counterintuitively, a lubricant. Emerging
from the Maoist era, a little graft gave officials
an incentive to do what was needed to support
growth, whether in selling state assets or
enticing firms to invest.
Debt also greased the wheels. Up to a point, the increase in borrowing is a
sign that the financial system is operating as it should, channelling savings
into investment. Virtually all developed economies have debt levels that are
at least as high as China’s, albeit mostly built up over longer periods.
The challenge now is to shift to a different economic model, because all three
factors are hitting their limits. Land is a finite resource, and the government’s
appropriations have got ahead of market need. Gan Li of Chengdu’s
Southwestern University of Finance and Economics estimates that 65m
homes—21% of urban housing stock—are vacant. Corruption has reached
corrosive levels. Frailties from all the debt are showing. Corporate-bond
defaults in 2018 reached $18bn, more than triple the previous annual record.
But turning onto a new path is hard. Local governments cannot easily find
revenue sources as bountiful as land. The anti-graft campaign has sapped the
motivation of officials while leaving the rotten system around them intact.
Efforts to tame debt have also hurt growth, forcing regulators to ease up in
recent months. China’s problems are simple enough to diagnose. Treatment,
though, is painful, and the disease more chronic than acute. So instead of
taking bitter medicine, officials hope time will be a balm. But China’s ills are
likely to get harder to cure -->

## Hong Kong and its region: At bay

2月18日，中国公布了期待已久的大湾区的主要蓝图，一个包括香港和澳门特别行政区，以及广东省南部9个城市的庞大城市群。人口7100万，总面积5.6万平方公里。 它会超越东京和旧金山等竞争对手成为迄今为止世界上最大的综合“海湾地区”。__总体规划要求大湾区发挥“在国家经济发展中的主导作用”。__

它有两个总体目标。 首先是将香港、澳门更密切地与大陆团结。澳门很少造成麻烦; but Hong Kong, a former British colony, has seen a rise in proindependence sentiment in recent years.

所以蓝图的序言点出大湾区将允许使香港和澳门的“同胞”“为一个强大而繁荣的祖国感到自豪”。

但是，该计划正在推向第二个目标。大湾区的目标是成为“一流”的 __创新中心__ 。这个想法是为了充分利用该地区城市的优势使他们相互合作而不是彼此竞争。香港将成为金融和其他专业服务的领导者。 __深圳__ ，腾讯等互联网科技巨头的所在地，将成为“具有全球影响力的创造力之都”。广东省相对较贫困的城市将继续专注于从智能机器人到新能源车辆的等产品的 __制造和生产__ 。

蓝图还为城市分配了新的产业。例如，__澳门应该发展中医药产业__ 而告别博彩业。商业区正在大湾区升温。咨询公司毕马威（KPMG）最近对该地区超过600位高管进行的一项调查显示发现80％的人支持“综合发展”。

中国政府已经在尝试将大湾区更密切地联系在一起。去年九月，香港连通了大陆的高铁网络。10月，一座连接香港，澳门和珠海的巨型桥梁开通。蓝图提出进一步的整合措施，例如相互承认专业技能资格。

但与其他城市群不同，大湾区涉及三个关税区，三个法律制度和两个硬边界（广东与香港和广东与澳门）。它的成功将取决于人员，货物和资本如何自由地流动。然而，香港人不会热衷于开放与广东接壤。

有些人有更大的担心。支持公民党党魁杨岳桥指出香港的长期优势在于“不是只是一个普通的中国城市“。香港被允许高度自治直到2047年。因此，例如，美国对中国敏感技术的出口限制到目前为止尚未适用于香港。然而随着香港越来越紧密联系大陆，杨岳桥担心大湾区可能会最终使香港失去特殊地位。在最坏的情况下，香港将被美国和世界其他地区当成只是另一个普通中国城市对待。
