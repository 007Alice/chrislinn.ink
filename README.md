# About Me

Hi all, I'm 醒来在刚果.

I have experience with blockchain PoW, P2P, wallet, script language and smart contract, atomic swap and chain interoperability. 

My current interests include but are not limited to: distributed system security, sharding and payment channel.

I am a Gopher. I am also a Rustacean.
